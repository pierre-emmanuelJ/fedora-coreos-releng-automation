# Configure a umask of 0002 which will allow for the group permissions
# to include write for newly created files. We need this because we'd
# like to access the OSTree repos from two different Kubernetes pods,
# which will have different UIDs but the same GID.
# See: https://pagure.io/releng/issue/8811#comment-616490
#
# This is also done within the coreos-ostree-importer-wrapper script,
# but we also want it done in the container because admins may run some
# ostree operations by hand from a bash prompt and we want those
# operations to not put the repo in a bad state.
